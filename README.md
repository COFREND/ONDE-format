# ONDE-format
Specification of the ONDE (Open Non Destructive Evaluation) Format


ONDE format results from a joint intiative by COFREND and EPRI to define a specification of open and efficient NDE formats in order to facilitate interoperability between softwares and to ensure ability to read the data in the long term. 

In order to achieve these objectives, it is based on the HDF5 format.

The present repository contains : 
* a csv file describing the fields  hdf5 structure 
* a markdown description of the ONDE UT specification

It will be complemented in the future by an extension to Eddy Current testing and by python tools allowing to check the compliance of a file to the specification.
